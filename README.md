## Description

The tool will extract key terms from the corpus, accompanied by glosses (definitions or explanations of each term).
Each keyword will be enriched with reference metadata, including the context of usage, document sources, and linguistic properties such as frequency, part of speech, and other relevant linguistic data.
Relations Between Keywords:

The tool will also identify and analyze the relations between keywords (such as hierarchical, causal, or associative relations).
Each relation will be categorized by type (e.g., synonymy, hyponymy, co-occurrence, etc.), allowing us to understand how these terms are conceptually and linguistically interconnected within the corpus.

The keywords will be grouped into clusters based on Leiden clustering algorithms. The granularity of these clusters can be adjusted based on factors such as term frequency, contextual similarity, and co-occurrence patterns, which will allow us to zoom in on smaller or broader conceptual groupings depending on the project's needs.

Using AI techniques, the tool will generate descriptive summaries for each cluster, explaining their common themes and significance. This will help in understanding the broader conceptual frameworks within the corpus and the way terms interact to form specialized knowledge domains.
